# PRM_LAB

Lab 2 - Activity controls, funny random number generator, basic sign up & login in(2-2)

Lab 3 - ListView, Adapter, The one with picture is lab 3.
Note: Renamed lab 3_2 to lab 3.

Lab 4 - Intent
Note: Lab 2_2 already demonstrated this.

Lab 5 - Recycler View
Note for Lab 5_2: 
+ Callback implementation of interface on adapter.
+ Instead of Java serialization, you can use parcel for faster approach. Also instead of making an public ArrayList just like MainApplication,
the data using parcel can be travel through multiple intents using Intents.
